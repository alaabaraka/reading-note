 JavaScript's expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more.

Operators (Links to an external site.)
JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence


Comparison operators (Links to an external site.)
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically. The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !==operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons.

Assignment operators (Links to an external site.)
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

 

Comparison operators (Links to an external site.)
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values.

 

Arithmetic operators (Links to an external site.)
An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.


Bitwise operators (Links to an external site.)
A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. For example, the decimal number nine has a binary representation of 1001.


Logical operators (Links to an external site.)
Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value.
