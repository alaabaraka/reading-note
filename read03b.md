SUMMARY

Html which stand for hypertext markup language is the most basic building block of the web,it defines the meaning and structure of web content.other technologies besides html are generally used to describe a web page appearance/presentation (CSS)or functionality/behaviour.

Hypertext refers to links that connects webpages together within a single website or within websites.links are fundamental aspects of the net,they help is link pages within websites or between two or more websites.

Html uses markup to anotate text,images and other content for display in a web browser.html markup includes special elements such as <head>,<title>,<body>,<header>,<article>,<section>,<aside>,<P>,<div>,<img>,<col>,<row>,<h1>,<h2>,<h3>,<h4>,<h5>,<h6>,<Li>,<ol>,<video>,<footer>etc.

HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content.

Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag. Note that the closing tag has the same text as the opening tag, but has an additional forward-slash ( / ) character. I tend to interperet this as the "end" or "close" character.

There are some tags that are an exception to this rule, and where a closing tag is not required. The <img> tag for showing images is one example of this.

Each HTML file must have the essential tags for it to be valid, so that web browsers can understand it and display it correctly.

The rest of the HTML file can contain as little or as many tags as you want to display your content.

Attributes allow you to customise a tag, and are defined within the opening tag, for example:
<img src="image1.jpg"> or <p align="center"> ... </p>

Attributes are often assigned a value using the equals sign, such as border="0" or width="50%", but there are some that only need to be declared in the tag like this: <hr noshade>.

Most attributes are optional for most tags, and are only used when you want to change something about the default way a tag is displayed by the browser. However, some tags such as the <img> tag has required attributes such as src and alt which are needed in order for the browser to display the web page properly.

Html element are set up use other text in a tag the elements are surrounded with the greater and less than symbol,when these elements are surrounded by these symbols they are called tags.the elements inside the tag is case insensitive or you can use capital or small letters,you can write html in an editor,we have some many editors amongst which are atom,visual studio code, sublime text and notepad etc and your html can be viewed in a browser,we have a hand full of browsers around among which includes Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome,internet explorer,opera mini etc

Usually your html CSS and JavaScript are written on different pages and linked together in other to have all the functionality work fine,we have what we call comments, comments are in executable lines of code,they are actually codes that the computer ignores,most a time they actually help to explain something.to write comments in html we use “<!- — — ->’ while in CSS we use /*. */.
